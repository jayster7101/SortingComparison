Friday Script - Dialogue Transcript
Voila! The Friday transcript is here, for all you fans of the Ice Cube and Chris Tucker movie. The Friday script was painstakingly transcribed using the screenplay and/or viewings of the movie. I'll be eternally tweaking it, so if you have any corrections, feel free to drop me a line. You won't hurt my feelings. Honest.
Swing on back to Drew's Script-O-Rama afterwards for more free scripts!

CRAIG: For most people,






Friday is just the day

before the weekend.






But after this Friday,






the neighbourhood

will never be the same.






(Bangs on door)








(Hits toe)






Oh, shit.






What's up?






Good morning.






Are you prepared

for Jehovah's return?






Because if you're not,






I have a pamphlet here that...






Well, fuck you.






Half-dead motherfucker.








Come on, sister.






Come on, sister.






Yeah.






(Chuckles)






Uh-oh.






I gotcha.






Gotcha baby.






That's right.








Damn.






(CHEWING NOISES)






Ain't nothin'

Every time I come

in the kitchen,






you in the kitchen...






In the goddamn

refrigerator,






eating up all the food...






All the chicken,

all the pig feet,






all the collard green,








all the hog maws.






I wanna eat some of them

chit'lins. I love pig feet.






Now, when I went to bed

last night,






didn't I tell you

to take out the trash?






Yeah.






So why didn't you do it?






I fell asleep.






I wish you was sleeping

right now.








I'd knock you upside

your head with a left,






make your ass wake up

and take out the trash!






Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!






What are you doing?






I'm throwing this away.

We ain't even got no milk.






You put some water

What's up, Craig?






Don't "what's up" me.

You better not.






Get your bad ass

Go look in my dresser.






You need a wig.

Shut the door.

I grab a dog, and I choke him,






and I kick the shit

out of him,








and all day long,

Just bang, bang, bang

up his ass!






That's my pleasure!






I don't think so.






I tell you one thing.






Around here,

Mama, where Craig at?






I don't know.






There's Joann. Go ask

her if she's seen them.






Sounded like a bomb.








Joann, you seen Craig

and Smokey in there?






I thought they were over there.






Deebo, you seen Craig

and Smokey around here?






Earlier.






Damn.






What she say?






She ain't seen him, and Deebo

ain't seen him.






MRS JONES: See why you have

to tell us before you leave?






Look at your face!








It'll be OK.

No, look at your face.






Who do you think you are?






What are you talking about?






You know what

I'm talking about, punk.






You hit my sister like

she was a fucking man.






She had no business

going through my pants.






My sister don't need

to steal nothing






from your broke ass.








Take your ass home.






I'm not scared of you.






All these niggers around here






might be scared of you,

but I'm not.






You take your ass home.






No, fuck you.






You're lucky I'm not a man.






Otherwise I'd kick

your ass myself.






Shut up!








Deebo, man, you trippin'.






What you say, little nigger?






Man, that's a female.






Shut your little

punk ass up, nigger,






before I drop you

like I did this bitch.






Man, I ain't trying

to fight you, Deebo.






Ezel.






You want to fight me








'cause you ain't nothin'

but a bitch too.






What are you going

to do with that...






...besides make me mad?






Put the gun down, son.






DEEBO: Huh?






Put the gun down, son.






Yeah. Put that gun down, son,






and get knocked down

like your father used to.








(GUNSHOT)






This was all the protection

we needed.






You win some, you lose some.






But you live...






You live to fight another day.






You think you're a man






with that gun

in your hand, don't you?






I'm a man without it.






(ECHOING)








Yeah.






Put that gun down, son.






And get knocked down

like your father used to.






Give me the gun, son.






Craig.






Give me... give me the gun.






Give me the gun, son.






(Laughs)








That's all you got?






Drop him, Craig! Craig! Craig!






Craig! Aw, shit!






Get up, Craig! Get up, Craig!






Oh, shit! God!






God damn.






Uh-uh!






No, no, no, come on,

baby! Let him be a man.






Go to sleep! Go to sleep! Yeah!








Shoot him.






See, he's not fighting fair!






Uh-uh!






I been down before.

I been down before.






I taught him better than this.






Come on, Craig!






Come on, Craig!






Told y'all! Y'all want some?








Beat him down! Beat you down!






Who else want some?






Who else want some of Deebo?






DANA: Craig, get up!






MR JONES: Get up, Craig!






Come on, Craig!






Stand up, Craig! Stand up!






There you go!






Hey, punk!








Yes, Mr Big Shot.






Fucking... Yeah, crawl, punk!






Crawl, bitch!






Whoop him, Craig! Whoop his ass!






Ooh, that's what

I'm talking about!






That's my dog!






Take that.






That's my dog!








Ain't that right, Ma?






That's my dog! Mr Parker!






That's my dog!






That's my dog!






Cutie pie.






If anybody got to say anything,

you let me know.






That's my dog.






You OK?






Yeah.








Craig.






No, no, cupcake.

Leave him alone.






Let him be a man.






I taught him good, didn't I?






Now who's the punk?






He think he a mack.

Macaroni.






You got knocked

the fuck out, man.






Give me my goddamn money.








The payback's

a motherfucker, ain't it?






Pow, pow, pow.






Shana, come on.






Come on, Mama.






My grandmama gave me this chain.






Deebo! Deebo!






Man, you should have been

bobbing and weaving.






Look at you. Get up!






Since you ain't,

I'll take these shoes.








Big foot motherfucker,

you can have your knife.






'Cause I steal, I don't kill.






How's your back feeling?






It'll be cool.






Bleeding and shit.






What time you waking up

in the morning?






8:30. Why?






I was just wondering








if maybe you were

feeling better,






then, um, you could come over.






I'm feeling better already.






I'm going to call you tomorrow.






Alright.






8:30, right?






Yes.






Hey... 7:30.






(Laughs)








That's right.






(PHONE RINGS)






CRAIG: Hello?






JOl: Why you can't

call nobody back?






Which one of your hos






has somebody

shooting at you?






I don't know why

I waste my time






on your old

stupid ass anyway.








I don't know either.






It's over. Bitch!






(DIAL TONE)






Yeah, I got your money,






and I don't appreciate






you sending your punk ass, buster

ass, jheri curl ass friends






to shoot at me and my homie.






They liked to got dealt with.






Don't be calling here like you

some straight up "g",








'cause I'll cut your balls off






and hand them to you, partner.






I had to warn you too many times

about my money, Smokey.






It's the principle

of the whole thing.






There's principalities

in this.






Well, yeah. I got

your money anyway,






and you sell that shit



yourself next time








'cause I'm going to rehab.






I'm through with this shit.






I was just bullshittin',

and you know this, man.






RAP SONG:

# You know it ain't no stopping






# All the dogs I'm dropping






# It's Friday night,

so everything is popping






# I got spin

that's been on the head






# So let the games begin






# Yakety yak, don't talk back,

go to a song








# Calling up earl

on the car phone






# Mac 10

just got out of court






# Roaming through the hood

in a super sport






# Bumper too short






# 18's got the rear view

mirror's vibrating






# And deep dish dating






# You know how we do it,

ain't nothing to it






# But the floss of the crowd,

Harris & Ross








# 'Cause if you fuck with ours,

we leave scars






# On a "g" right course,

living like stars






# Might hit the highway

on the Vegas run






# Fool, 'cause it's Friday






# Oh, yeah, throw

your neighbourhood in the air






# If you don't care






# Oh, yeah, throw

your neighbourhood in the air






# If you don't care








# Standing outside

on the Friday






# Living on the edge






# 'Cause we all

got them hard heads






# It seems like we all away






# For the drive-by,

playing tag with Satan






# But we chillin',

yeah, we ready and willin'






# You hear about

the latest west side killing?






# But we slippin', say trippin'






# For dipping, pistol gripping,

never slipping








# Big g's

trying to hang out






# But old "g" said, take

your little ass in the house






# My big homie just got out






# Used to be damned,

now we just crack dead






# He's about

as hard as Darth Vader






# In his sweatshirt,

khakis, and chuck taylors






# Just seen them

in the driveway






# Getting beat like a smoker,

fool, 'cause it's Friday








# Oh, yeah, throw

your neighbourhood in the air






# If you don't care






# Oh, yeah, throw

your neighbourhood in the air






# If you don't care, fool






# Why must I be like that

and chase the cat?






# Or settle for a hood rack?






# Do be brave






# No dreadlocks flying

in and out of town






# With half a chicken

and a cock








# And I love her






# 'Cause she dared

to fuck around






# With the underground






# Pussy hound, and her ass

is big, round, and wide






# Jacked up,

making niggers down the rye






# Smoking in dope,

playing that super Nintendo






# Hear a rat-a-tat

on my window






# There goes that

pelvic thrust








# Don't trust a rubber,

'cause it's bound to bust






# In the oven, in the nappy






# I had on 2, so I was happy






# 'Cause that HIV will

make your dick hang sideways






# And that ain't cool, fool,

'cause it's Friday






# Throw your neighbourhood

in the air, if you don't care






# Oh, yeah, throw

your neighbourhood in the air






# If you don't care. #
