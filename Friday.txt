Friday Script - Dialogue Transcript
Voila! The Friday transcript is here, for all you fans of the Ice Cube and Chris Tucker movie. The Friday script was painstakingly transcribed using the screenplay and/or viewings of the movie. I'll be eternally tweaking it, so if you have any corrections, feel free to drop me a line. You won't hurt my feelings. Honest.
Swing on back to Drew's Script-O-Rama afterwards for more free scripts!

CRAIG: For most people,






Friday is just the day

before the weekend.






But after this Friday,






the neighbourhood

will never be the same.






(Bangs on door)








(Hits toe)






Oh, shit.






What's up?






Good morning.






Are you prepared

for Jehovah's return?






Because if you're not,






I have a pamphlet here that...






Well, fuck you.






Half-dead motherfucker.








Come on, sister.






Come on, sister.






Yeah.






(Chuckles)






Uh-oh.






I gotcha.






Gotcha baby.






That's right.








Damn.






(CHEWING NOISES)






Ain't nothin'

Every time I come

in the kitchen,






you in the kitchen...






In the goddamn

refrigerator,






eating up all the food...






All the chicken,

all the pig feet,






all the collard green,








all the hog maws.






I wanna eat some of them

chit'lins. I love pig feet.






Now, when I went to bed

last night,






didn't I tell you

to take out the trash?






Yeah.






So why didn't you do it?






I fell asleep.






I wish you was sleeping

right now.








I'd knock you upside

your head with a left,






make your ass wake up

and take out the trash!






Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!






What are you doing?






I'm throwing this away.

We ain't even got no milk.






You put some water

What's up, Craig?






Don't "what's up" me.

You better not.






Get your bad ass

Go look in my dresser.






You need a wig.

Shut the door.

I grab a dog, and I choke him,






and I kick the shit

out of him,








and all day long,

Just bang, bang, bang

up his ass!






That's my pleasure!






I don't think so.






I tell you one thing.






Around here,

Mama, where Craig at?






I don't know.






There's Joann. Go ask

her if she's seen them.






Sounded like a bomb.








Joann, you seen Craig

and Smokey in there?






I thought they were over there.






Deebo, you seen Craig

and Smokey around here?






Earlier.






Damn.






What she say?






She ain't seen him, and Deebo

ain't seen him.






MRS JONES: See why you have

to tell us before you leave?






Look at your face!








It'll be OK.

No, look at your face.






Who do you think you are?






What are you talking about?






You know what

I'm talking about, punk.






You hit my sister like

she was a fucking man.






She had no business

going through my pants.






My sister don't need

to steal nothing






from your broke ass.








Take your ass home.






I'm not scared of you.






All these niggers around here






might be scared of you,

but I'm not.






You take your ass home.






No, fuck you.






You're lucky I'm not a man.






Otherwise I'd kick

your ass myself.






Shut up!








Deebo, man, you trippin'.






What you say, little nigger?






Man, that's a female.






Shut your little

punk ass up, nigger,






before I drop you

like I did this bitch.






Man, I ain't trying

to fight you, Deebo.






Ezel.






You want to fight me








'cause you ain't nothin'

but a bitch too.






What are you going

to do with that...






...besides make me mad?






Put the gun down, son.






DEEBO: Huh?






Put the gun down, son.






Yeah. Put that gun down, son,






and get knocked down

like your father used to.








(GUNSHOT)






This was all the protection

we needed.






You win some, you lose some.






But you live...






You live to fight another day.






You think you're a man






with that gun

in your hand, don't you?






I'm a man without it.






(ECHOING)








Yeah.






Put that gun down, son.






And get knocked down

like your father used to.






Give me the gun, son.






Craig.






Give me... give me the gun.






Give me the gun, son.






(Laughs)








That's all you got?






Drop him, Craig! Craig! Craig!






Craig! Aw, shit!






Get up, Craig! Get up, Craig!






Oh, shit! God!






God damn.






Uh-uh!






No, no, no, come on,

baby! Let him be a man.






Go to sleep! Go to sleep! Yeah!








Shoot him.






See, he's not fighting fair!






Uh-uh!






I been down before.

I been down before.






I taught him better than this.






Come on, Craig!






Come on, Craig!






Told y'all! Y'all want some?








Beat him down! Beat you down!






Who else want some?






Who else want some of Deebo?






DANA: Craig, get up!






MR JONES: Get up, Craig!






Come on, Craig!






Stand up, Craig! Stand up!






There you go!






Hey, punk!








Yes, Mr Big Shot.






Fucking... Yeah, crawl, punk!






Crawl, bitch!






Whoop him, Craig! Whoop his ass!






Ooh, that's what

I'm talking about!






That's my dog!






Take that.






That's my dog!








Ain't that right, Ma?






That's my dog! Mr Parker!






That's my dog!






That's my dog!






Cutie pie.






If anybody got to say anything,

you let me know.






That's my dog.






You OK?






Yeah.








Craig.






No, no, cupcake.

Leave him alone.






Let him be a man.






I taught him good, didn't I?






Now who's the punk?






He think he a mack.

Macaroni.






You got knocked

the fuck out, man.






Give me my goddamn money.








The payback's

a motherfucker, ain't it?






Pow, pow, pow.






Shana, come on.






Come on, Mama.






My grandmama gave me this chain.






Deebo! Deebo!






Man, you should have been

bobbing and weaving.






Look at you. Get up!






Since you ain't,

I'll take these shoes.








Big foot motherfucker,

you can have your knife.






'Cause I steal, I don't kill.






How's your back feeling?






It'll be cool.






Bleeding and shit.






What time you waking up

in the morning?






8:30. Why?






I was just wondering








if maybe you were

feeling better,






then, um, you could come over.






I'm feeling better already.






I'm going to call you tomorrow.






Alright.






8:30, right?






Yes.






Hey... 7:30.






(Laughs)








That's right.






(PHONE RINGS)






CRAIG: Hello?






JOl: Why you can't

call nobody back?






Which one of your hos






has somebody

shooting at you?






I don't know why

I waste my time






on your old

stupid ass anyway.








I don't know either.






It's over. Bitch!






(DIAL TONE)






Yeah, I got your money,






and I don't appreciate






you sending your punk ass, buster

ass, jheri curl ass friends






to shoot at me and my homie.






They liked to got dealt with.






Don't be calling here like you

some straight up "g",








'cause I'll cut your balls off






and hand them to you, partner.






I had to warn you too many times

about my money, Smokey.






It's the principle

of the whole thing.






There's principalities

in this.






Well, yeah. I got

your money anyway,






and you sell that shit



yourself next time








'cause I'm going to rehab.






I'm through with this shit.






I was just bullshittin',

and you know this, man.

To be clear, I don’t want to die on Mars. It’s like, if… we’re all going to die someday, and if you’re going to pick some place to die, then why not Mars? You know, if you’re born on Earth, why not die on Mars? Seems like may be quite exciting. But, I think given the choice between dying on Earth and dying on Mars, I’d say, yeah, sure, I’ll die on Mars. But it’s not some kind of Mars death wish. And if I do die on Mars, I just don’t want to go on impact.
Let’s come back to Earth, actually. You tweeted that you are building a tunnel under Washington D.C. Why?

What is it? – It’s a secret plot. – Okay. – Just between us. – Nobody helps you? Yeah, exactly, let’s keep that a secret. I think this is going to sound a little… I mean, it seems like so much trivial or silly, but… I’ve been saying this for many years now, but I think that the solution to urban congestion is a network of tunnels under cities. And when I say that I don’t mean a 2-D plan of tunnels, I mean tunnels that go many levels deep. So, you can always go deeper than you can go up. Like, the deepest mines are deeper than the tallest buildings. So, you can have a network of tunnels that is 20, 30, 40, 50 levels, as many levels as you want, really. And so, given that, you can overcome the congestion situation in any city in the world. The challenge is how do you build tunnels quickly and at low cost and with high safety? So, if tunnel technology can be improved to the point where you can build tunnels fast, cheap and safe, then that would completely get rid of any traffic situations in the cities. And so, that’s why I think it’s an important technology. And, Washington D.C., L.A and most of the major American cities, most major cities in the world suffer from severe traffic issues. And it’s mostly because you’ve got these buildings which are, these tall buildings that are 3-D and you have a road network that is one level. And then, people generally want to go in and out of these buildings at the exact same time. So, then, you get the traffic jam.

Let’s come back to… your year in Dubai. The first time I met you it was the 4th of June 2015, at your office in SpaceX. And, I asked you would you have a presence in UAE? And your answer was: I’m busy with China. Maybe not in the near future, and almost a year and a half later, we are here, seems time goes quite fast. Why now?

I think actually things are going really well in China. So, we have some initial challenges figuring out charging and service infrastructure and various other things, but now it’s actually going really well, and… so the timing seems to be good to really make a significant debut in this region, starting in Dubai.

In your opinion, what is the new disturbing thing that will come next in technology? What’s next in technology? – What’s next in technology? – That will disturb the way we live, the way we think, the way we do business.
Well, the most near to impact from a technological standpoint is autonomous cars, like fully self-driving cars. I’d say that’s going to happen much faster than people realize. so, and that’s… it’s going to be a great convenience to be in an autonomous car, but there are many people whose job is to drive. So, if… in fact I think it might be the single largest employer of people is driving in various forms. And so, then we need to figure out new rules for what do these people do. But it will all be very disruptive and very quick. I should characterize what I mean by quick. Because there are… Quick means different things to different people. There are about two billion vehicles in the world. Approaching in fact 2.5 billion cars and trucks in the world. The total new vehicle production capacity is about a hundred million. Which makes sense, because the life of a car or truck before it’s finally scraped is about 20-25 years. So, so the point at which we see full autonomy appear will not be the point at which there is massive societal upheaval, because it will take a long time to make enough autonomous vehicles to disrupt employment. So, that disruption I’m talking about will take place over about 20 years. Still, 20 years is a short period of time to have I think something like 12 to 15 per cent of the world force be unemployed.

Thank you. This is the largest global government summit we have over 139 governments here. If you want to advise government officials to be ready for the future, what three pieces of advice can you give them?

Well, I think the first bit of advice is to really play close attention to… the development of artificial intelligence. I think this is, we need to be just be very careful in… how we adopt artificial intelligence, and to make sure that researchers don’t get carried away, because sometimes what happens is that scientists can get so engrossed in their work, they don’t necessarily realize the ramifications of what they’re doing. So, I think it’s important for public safety that we… you know, governments keep a close eye on artificial intelligence and make sure that it does not represent a danger to the public. Let’s see, secondly, I would say we do need to think about transport in general. And, there’s the movement towards electric vehicles, sustainable transport, I think that’s going to be good for many reasons, but again, not something that happens immediately, that’s going to happen slower than the self-driving vehicles. Because that’s probably something that happens over 30 or 40 years. The transition to electric vehicles. So, thinking about that in context… the demand for electricity will increase dramatically. So, currently, in terms of total energy usage in the world, it’s about 1/3, about 1/3 transport, about 1/3 heating. So, over time that will transition to almost all… not all, but predominantly electricity, which means that the demand for electricity will probably triple. So, it’s going to be very important to think about, how do you make so much more electricity? And…

It seems they’ll have an easy job, that’s it, there are no more challenges for them.

No, well, I think maybe… these things do play into each other a little bit, but what to do about mass unemployment? This is going to be a massive social challenge. And I think ultimately will have to have some kind of universal basic income I don’t think we’re going to have a choice. – Universal basic income. – Universal basic income. I think it’s going to be necessary.
So, it means that unemployed people will be paid across the globe. – Yeah. – Because there are no jobs. Machines, robots are taking over.
There will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better. That’s simply… And I want to be clear, these are not things that I wish would happen. These are simply things that I think probably will happen. And so, if my assessment is correct and they probably will happen, then we need to say what are we going to do about it. And I think some kind of universal basic income is going to be necessary. Now, the output of goods and services will be extremely high. So, with automation, there will come abundance. There will be… almost everything will get very cheap. The… So… I think the biggest… I think we’ll just end up doing a universal basic income. It’s going to be necessary. The harder challenge, much harder challenge, is how do people then have meaning? Like a lot of people, they derive their meaning from their employment, so, if you don’t have… if you’re not needed, if there’s not a need for your labor, how do you… what’s the meaning? Do you have meaning? Do you feel useless? That’s a much harder problem to deal with. And then how do we ensure that the future is going to be the future that we want? That we so like.

You know, I mean do think that there’s a potential path here which is, I’m really getting into science fiction or sort of advanced science stuff. But, having some sort of merger with biological intelligence, and machine intelligence. To some degree, we are already a cyborg. You think of like the digital tools that you have, your phone and your computer, the applications that you have. Like the fact that as I mentioned earlier you can ask a question and instantly get an answer from Google or from other things. And, and so you already have a digital touchery layer. I say touchery because you can think of the limbic system, kind of the animal brain or the primal brain and then the cortex, kind of the thinking, planning part of the brain, and then your digital self as a third layer. So, you already have that, and I think if somebody dies, their digital ghost is still around. All of their e-mails and the pictures that they posted and their social media. That still lives, even if they died. So, over time I think we’ll probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence. And it’s mostly about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and your digital… the digital extension of yourself. Particularly output, and, if anything is getting worse, you know, we used to have keyboards that we used a lot, now we do most of our input through our thumbs, on a phone. And, that’s just very slow. A computer can communicate at a trillion bits per second, but your thumb can maybe do maybe 10 bits per second or a hundred if you’re being generous. So, some high bandwidth interface to the brain I think will be something that helps achieve symbiosis, between human and machine intelligence and maybe solves the control problem and the usefulness problem. I’m getting pretty esoteric here, I don’t know is this is…

It’s close, we got it. Always you think out of the box. Your ideas are so huge. You want to go to space, you decided to go to space, you did it. You decided that you wanted to land your rocket back, – you failed, 7 times, 8 times? – Yeah, something like that. – Then it landed. – 4 times that I care to count. How do you come with these ideas? Sometimes they are pushing the human limit. You are always pushing the human limit, why?
Well, I… I think about what technology solution is necessary in order to achieve that particular goal, and then try to make as much progress in that direction as possible. So, in the case of space flight, the critical breakthrough that’s necessary in space flight, is rapid incomplete reusability of rockets. Just as we have for air crafts. You can imagine that if an aircraft was a single use, almost no one would fly. Because you can buy like, say, 747 might be… 250 million Dollars, 300 million Dollars, something like that. You need two of them for a round trip. But nobody is going to pay millions of Dollars for a ticket to fly. To do air travel. So, but because you can re-use the aircraft tens of thousands of times, the… Air travel becomes much more affordable. And, the same is true of rockets. Our rocket costs… 60 million Dollars, roughly. So, a capital cost if it can be used once in 60 million Dollars. But if the capital cost if it can be used a thousand times is 60 thousand Dollars. So, then if you can carry a lot of people for a flight, then you can get the cost of space flight to be something not far from the cost of air flight. So, it’s truly fundamental, because earth gravity is quite deep. Earth has a fairly high gravity. The difficulty of making a rocket reusable is much greater than the difficulty of making an aircraft reusable. That’s why a fully reusable rocket hasn’t been developed that far. But if you use the most advanced materials, the most advanced design techniques, and you get everything just right, then I’m confident that you can do a fully reusable rocket. Fortunately, if Earth gravity was even 10 per cent stronger, I would say it wouldn’t be impossible.

You need a team around you to deliver a lot of ideas. How do you choose your team? Based on what?

Well, I suppose honestly that it tends to be a gut feeling more than anything else. So, when I interview somebody, the main questions are always the same. What do you ask? I say: Tell me the story of your life. And, the decisions that you made along the way and why you made them. And then, and also tell me about some of the most difficult problems you worked on and how you solved them. And, that question I think is very important, because… the people that really solved the problem, they know exactly how they solved it. They know the little details. And the people that pretended to solve the problem, they can maybe go one level and then they get stuck.
So, what was your biggest challenge in life? Biggest challenge in life? – No challenge?

Well, no, there’s a lot of them. I’m trying to sort which is the worst. I think just thinking about how to spend time. One of the biggest challenges I think is making sure you have a corrective feedback loop, and then maintaining that corrective feedback loop over time, even when people won’t to tell you exactly what you want to hear.

That’s very difficult. – Yes. Time is over. I’ll ask you just one last question. If you allow me. In the World Government Summit we have so many people from… so many young people actually from across the Globe. If you have an advice to them, young people globally who want to be like Elon Musk. What’s your advice to them?

I think that probably they shouldn’t want to be. – You? – I think it sounds better than it is. Okay. Yeah, it’s not as much fun being me as you’d think. – I don’t know. – You don’t think so? It could be worse, for sure. But it’s… I’m not sure I want to be me. Okay. But… You know, I think my advice is if you want to make progress in things, I think that the best analytical framework for, I’ll say in the future is physics. I’d recommend studying the thinking process around physics. Like, not just the equations, the equations are certainly very helpful, but the way of thinking in physics, it’s the best framework for understanding things that are counter–intuitive. And, you know, always take the position that you are to some degree wrong, and your goal is to be less wrong over time. One of the biggest mistakes people generally make and I’m guilty of it too is wishful thinking. You know, like you want something to be true, even if it isn’t true. And so you ignore the things that… You ignore the real truth, because of what you want to be true. This is a very difficult trap to avoid. And like I said, it’s certainly one that I find myself in, having problems with. But, if you just take that approach of that you’re always to some degree wrong and your goal is to be less wrong. And solicit critical feedback, particularly from friends. Like, friends, if somebody loves you they want the best for you. They don’t want to tell you the bad things. So, you have to ask them and say: I do really want to know. And then they will tell you.

Thank you very much. It’s been… It’s great for the World Government Summit to have a legend, who’s creating the future for humanity, to share his thoughts, his ideas, his visions, challenges, and his hope for life. Thank you very much.

Thanks for having me.”

 'You've got to find what you love,' Jobs says
This is a prepared text of the Commencement address delivered by Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple
Computer and of Pixar Animation Studios, on June 12, 2005 (Stanford University Graduation).
I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the
world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college
graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.
The first story is about connecting the dots.
I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another
18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?
It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and
she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college
graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that
when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who
were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected baby boy;
do you want him?" They said: "Of course." My biological mother later found out that my mother had
never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to
sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I
would someday go to college.
And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as
Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six
months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how
college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had
saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty
scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped
out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones
that looked interesting. 
2
It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned
coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every
Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I
stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give
you one example:
Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout
the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had
dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn
how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between
different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical,
artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.
None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were
designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It
was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in
college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since
Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never
dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might
not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots
looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.
Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So
you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something —
your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the
difference in my life.
My second story is about love and loss.
I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage
when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage
into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the
Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from
a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run
the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future
began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with
him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was
gone, and it was devastating.
I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of
entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David
Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure,
and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me —
I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected,
but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.
I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have
ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a 
3
beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my
life.
During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell
in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first
computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the
world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we
developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful
family together.
I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting
medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose
faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to
find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill
a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.
And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking.
Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great
relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't
settle.
My third story is about death.
When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last,
someday you'll most certainly be right." It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33
years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my
life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too
many days in a row, I know I need to change something.
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make
the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of
embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly
important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking
you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly
showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was
almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three
to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for
prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to
tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy
as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.
I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope
down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a
few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed
the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of
pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I'm fine now.

This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades.
Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a
useful but purely intellectual concept.
No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet
death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because
Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to
make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will
gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma — which
is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out
your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They
somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.
When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one
of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in
Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960's, before personal
computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras.
It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, and
overflowing with neat tools and great notions.
Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its
course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their
final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself
hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." It
was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished
that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.
Thank you all very much.
